# Jordan Alaniz

**High school student focused on engineering, simulation, and software development.**

I build physics-based and ecological simulations, experiment with models of real systems, and write about what works and what doesn’t.

## Featured Work

### Ecological Simulation
A multi-system simulation modeling climate, populations, and human impact.

### Physics & Mechanical Modeling
Force analysis and structural modeling for mechanical systems.

### Software Projects
Smaller experiments focused on correctness, performance, and design.
